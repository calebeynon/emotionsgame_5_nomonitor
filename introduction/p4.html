Each period consists of 2 stages.<br>
In stage 1, you will have a chance to communicate with other participants in your group
through a chat box. For period 1 of each stage you will have 2 minutes (or 120 seconds) to
chat. In each of the subsequent periods, you will have only 30 seconds to chat.<br>
You can chat about any topic but please avoid profanities and offensive language. These
will not be tolerated. Do not use any language other than English. Also, avoid revealing
your current seating location or personal identifying information about yourself such as
your name, age, major, gender, etc.<br>
It is important that we practice this feature before the study begins. On the bottom of
the screen you see a text field. You are now randomly matched with 3 other participants
in this session. You will not be matched with these participants again in the study. Try to
send them messages. Once you are familiar with the chat box, please click the “Continue”
button.
