    <p>
Each segment consists of an uncertain number of <b>periods</b>. The number of periods in
a segment is determined as follows:
    </p>
  <ul>
    <li>For each period, the computer has randomly selected a number from 1 to 5, each
with a 20% chance, for the entire session to determine whether another period of the
same segment will follow.</li>
    <li> If the selected number is from 1 to 4, the next period will follow. If the selected
number is 5, the segment will end.</li>
    <li>We will reveal the selected number to you at the end of each period. So, at the
beginning of each period, you only know that there is an 80% chance that another
period of the same segment will follow and there is a 20% chance that the segment
will end after this period.</li>
  </ul>
