    <b> Welcome </b><br>
        <p>Welcome to our study. At this time, please make sure you have turned off and put away
        all personal electronic devices. This study will take no more than 75 minutes. You will
        be paid your earnings from the study in addition to the $7.50 participation
        payment in cash. Your earnings will depend on the decisions you and others make in this
        study, so it is important that you fully understand these instructions. These earnings will
        be denominated in Experimental Currency Units (or ECUs for short). At the end of the
        study, ECUs will be converted into dollars at the exchange rate of 10 ECUs for $1.00
        and will be paid to you privately in cash. If you have a question at any point, please raise
        your hand.</p><br>

        <b>Structure</b><br>
    
        <p>You will interact with other participants in this session through a computer program.
        Your personal identifying information will not be revealed to anyone. To the participants
        that you will interact with, you will be referred to as a unique alphabet letter randomly assigned
        to you. For this session, you will be referred to as <br><br>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><b>“Participant {{player.participant.label}}”</b></div><br>
        This study consists of 5 <b>segments</b>. At the beginning of each segment, all participants
        will be randomly placed in a group of 4. Each group will remain the same throughout the
        segment. When a new segment begins, all participants will be randomly placed in a new
        group of 4. In these 5 segments, you will be placed in 5 different groups and will not
        interact with the same persons in different segments.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Segment 3 -->
    <div class="segment">
        <b>Ending of Segments</b><br>
        <p>Each segment consists of an uncertain number of rounds. The number of rounds in a segment is randomly 
            selected by the computer in the following manner: after each round, there is an 80% chance that another round of the same
            segment will follow and there is a 20% chance that the segment will end after that round. You can think about this in the following way:
        </p><br>
        <p> <p>In each round, the computer will randomly select a number from 1 to 5, if the selected number is from 1 to 4, the next round will follow.
             If the selected number is 5, the segment will end.
        </p>

    </div>
    
    <!-- Segment 4 -->
    <div class="segment">
        <b>Tokens and allocation</b><br>
        
        <p><ul>
            <li>Each participant is endowed with 25 tokens at the beginning of each round and has to allocate these tokens between
        a <b>Private Account</b> and a <b>Group Account</b>. Each participant has their own Private
        Account and there is only one Group Account for each group. </li>
            <li>You will earn 1.0 ECU for each token you allocate to your Private Account. Each
        token allocated to the Group Account yields a return of 1.6 ECUs.
        Everyone in the group will receive an equal share of earnings from the Group Account.
        Since there are 4 participants in a group, each participant will receive<br><br><b>
        <div style="text-align: center;">&frac14; x 1.6 x the total number of tokens in the the Group Account</b></div><br>
        in ECUs.
        </li><br>
            <li>We would like to emphasize each participant in a group will receive the same amount
        of ECUs from the Group Account, even though each allocated a different number of
        tokens to the Group Account</li>
            </ul></p>

    <div class="segment">
        <b>Decisions</b><br>
    
        <p>Each round consists of 2 stages.<br>
            <ul>
                <li>In stage 1, you will divide your 25 tokens between the Private Account and the Group Account. Below, you will
                    enter the number of tokens you want to allocate to the Group Account. (Enter a whole number between 0 and 25 to allocate to the Group Account).
                    The computer will automatically show how many tokens are allocated to the Private Account.</li>
                <li>In stage 2, you will view the results of the round and chat with your group members.</li>
                <li>You will be able to see <b>the total number of tokens in the group, but not the allocations of the other group members</b></li>
                <li>You will be able to chat with your group members for up to 90 seconds. Please avoid profanities and offensive language. This
                    will not be tolerated. Do not use any language other than English. Also, avoid revealing
                    your current seating location or personal identifying information about yourself such as
                    your name, age, major, gender, etc.</li>
                <li>Even though you will make decisions in many rounds and the computer will calculate
                    your earnings in ECUs for all of these rounds, the computer will randomly select
                    <b><u>only 1 segment</u></b> to calculate your cash payment. The computer will use the sum of your
                    earnings from all rounds in the selected segment and convert it into dollars at the exchange
                    rate of 10 ECUs for $1.00. You will know which segment is selected for your cash earnings
                    at the end of the study.</li>
            </ul>
