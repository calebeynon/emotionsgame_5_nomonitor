    <p>
    Welcome to our study. At this time, please make sure you have turned off and put away
all personal electronic devices. This study will take no more than 75 minutes. You will
be paid your earnings from each part of the study in addition to the $7.50 participation
payment in cash. Your earnings will depend on the decisions you and others make in this
study, so it is important that you fully understand these instructions. These earnings will
be denominated in experimental currency units (or ECUs for short). At the end of the
study, ECUs will be converted into dollars at the exchange rate of 10 ECUs for 1 dollar
and will be paid to you privately in cash. If you have a question at any point, please raise
your hand.
