Consider the following examples.<br>
<ul>
<li>If each participant in a group allocates 0 tokens to the Group Account, then the
Group Account will have 0 tokens. Each participant will earn 25 ECUs from their
Private account and 0 ECUs from their Group Account. The total earnings for the
period will be 25 ECUs for each participant in the group. </li>
<li>If each participant in a group allocates 25 tokens to the Group Account, then the
Group Account will have 4 × 25 = 100 tokens. Each participant will earn 0 ECUs from their Private account and 
&frac14; × 1.6 × 100 = 40 ECUs from their Group Account.
The total earnings for the period will be 40 ECUs for each participant in the group.</li>
</ul>
<br>
Now you have a chance to make some practice decisions. By practicing, you will be-
come familiar with how your earnings are determined. You will not interact with other
participants during this practice, and your practice decisions will not be shown to anyone.
You will not earn anything for practice decisions.<br>
Just like in the decision tasks of this study, you will practice allocating ECUs between
your Private Account and the Group Account. During these practice decisions, you will also
choose hypothetical allocations for the three other participants in your group. Try different
allocations for all four participants and click the “calculate” button to see each participant’s
earnings. In the actual tasks, you will be matched with three human participants who will
make their own allocation decisions
