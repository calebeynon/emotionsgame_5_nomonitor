Even though you will make decisions in many periods and the computer will calcu-
late your earnings in ECUs for all of these periods, the computer will randomly select
<b><u>only 1 segment</u></b> to calculate your cash payment. The computer will use the sum of your

rate of 10 ECUs for 1 dollar. You will know which segment is selected for your cash earnings
at the end of the study.
