    <ul>
    <li>Each participant is endowed with 25 tokens and has to allocate these tokens between
a <b>Private Account</b> and a <b>Group Account</b>. Each participant has their own Private
Account and there is only one Group Account for each group. </li>
    <li>You will earn 1.0 ECU for each token you allocate to your Private Account. Each
token allocated to the Group Account of your group yields a return of 1.6 ECUs.
Everyone in the group will receive an equal share of earnings from the Group Account.
Since there are 4 participants in a group, each participant will receive<br>
&frac14; x 1.6 x the total number of tokens in the the Group Account<br>
in ECUs regardless of the number of tokens each has allocated to the Group Account
</li>
    <li>We would like to emphasize each participant in a group will receive the same amount
of ECUs from the Group Account, even though they allocated a different number of
tokens to the Group Account</li>
    </ul>
